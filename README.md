# Mines Digital Services

Mines Digital Services (MDS) upholds the BC Public Serviceâ€™s commitment to modernization, transparency, and efficiency, enabling better governance and service delivery when it comes to mining in British Columbia.

This project replaced the legacy Mine Management System (MMS) with a scalable, open source, data driven system using modern and flexible technologies.

The MDS have a number of interconnections and relationships to systems across the Natural Resource Ministries and is important not only to the Ministry of Mining and Critical Minerals but also to inter-agency collaborations across ministries, industry stakeholders and the public.

## Features

Key products that are maintained by MDS include Core, MineSpace and the public-facing [BC Mine Information website](https://mines.nrs.gov.bc.ca) [(github repository)](https://github.com/bcgov/NR-BCMI)

Mines Digital Services build features with these principles in mind:

1. MDS develops tools and platforms that prioritize ease of use for mining companies, regulators, and the public.
2. MDS supports access to high-quality geoscientific data and regulatory information, empowering government bodies and mining companies to make informed decisions.
3. MDS collaborates across government agencies and industries to create cohesive solutions that integrate regulatory processes, permitting, and compliance systems.
4. Digital tools from MDS help monitor and ensure mining activities adhere to environmental and social governance standards.
